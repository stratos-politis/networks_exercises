# Selected Exercises on Networks (Graph Theory)

### Contents
This repository is a collection of exercises on the subject "Networks" from FAU.

### Structure
Each assignment implements a different theoretical term in Network Science, to test on my knowledge on graph and network theory topics. It checks for theory comprehension and implements the different network schemas in NetworkX and Jupyter:
- **Introduction**: Graph basics, terminology, BFS/DFS traversal algorithms
- **Random Graphs**: Implementation of Erdös–Renyi graphs
- **Shortest Path**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths
- **Centrality Measures**: Exploration of Degree, Closeness, Eigenvector, PageRank, Betweenness centrality measures
- **Network Motifs**: Isomorphism, enumeration, sampling in non-random/structured graphs
- **Temporal Networks**: Structure, characterisstics, fastest and shortest paths in temporal networks
- **Evolving Networks**: Structure, characterisstics, models (uniform attachment, copying, edge selection, Barabasi-Albert) of evolving networks
- **Community Detection (1&2)**: Girvan-Newman and Spectral Clustering algorithms for community detection, modularity, Label Propagation algorithm
- **Node Classification**: Correct-and-Smooth model for classification, differences from LPA, variations of update rules
